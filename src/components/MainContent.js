			<p>What is this? Well, it's some cool stuff. I'm currently learning React, so in the future I'll use these skills for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A pom app</li>
				<li>A todo list app</li>
				<li>A basic chat application, maybe?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So yeah, there's going to be cool stuff here soon!</p>
